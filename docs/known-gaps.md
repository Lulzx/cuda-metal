# Known gaps

This is the maintained gap index. A missing item is not automatically supported;
current status must be backed by tests and evidence.

## Gap groups

- [Platform and legal boundaries](known-gaps/platform.md)
- [Compiler and toolchain gaps](known-gaps/compiler.md)
- [Runtime and CUDA semantic gaps](known-gaps/runtime.md)
- [Library shim gaps](known-gaps/libraries.md)
- [Verification, CI, and downstream gaps](known-gaps/verification.md)

## Highest-priority open work

1. Expand typed CuMetal IR beyond the now-matched reviewed compile corpus and
   broaden numerical coverage.
2. Establish a recurring verification mechanism outside GitHub Actions and
   commission the trusted Apple-GPU lane; the fixed 185-test Phase 4 denominator
   is now defined.
3. Validate genuinely distinct supported Xcode toolchains.
4. Finish runtime/library semantic matrices and bounded binary-container forms.

The named five-kernel Phase 5 release set is closed for its selected-set
criterion; broader performance claims remain explicitly out of scope.

The executable priority/evidence table is in
[the specification closure roadmap](spec-closure-roadmap.md).
